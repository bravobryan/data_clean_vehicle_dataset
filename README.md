# Data Cleaning
## Cleaning Findings
- **Duplicate Row Findings**
    - After removing the `description` column, 31 duplicate rows were found in the dataset.
- **Missing Value Findings**
    - **223** missing values were found in the `price`, `engine`, `cylinders`, `fuel`, `mileage`, `transmission`, `trim`, `body`, `doors`, `exterior_color`, and `interior_color` columns.
    - Count of missing values per column:
        - price: 23 missing,
        - engine: 2 missing,
        - cylinders: 103 missing,
        - fuel: 7 missing,
        - mileage: 32 missing,
        - transmission: 2 missing,
        - trim: 1 missing,
        - body: 3 missing,
        - doors: 7 missing,
        - exterior_color: 5 missing, and
        - interior_color: 38 missing.
    - Data Sparsity of < 2%.

- **Outlier Findings**
    - The quantitative variables inspected for outliers were the `price`, `cylinders`, `mileage`, and `doors` columns.
- `price`: 28 outliers found, right-skew distribution.

- `cylinders`: 104 outliers found, left-skew distribution.

![figure03.png](./images/figure03.png)

- `mileage`: 112 outliers found, right-skew distribution.

![figure04.png](./images/figure04.png)

- `doors`: 47 outliers found, left-skew distribution.

## Mitigation Methods
- Dropped the `description` column
    - A new DataFrame named `vehicle_only_df` was created by dropping the description column, which is best suited for analysis using NLP techniques and will be excluded from the DataFrame.
